		<p>Laptops have integrated parts, which mean that they are small, less powerful, and therefore generate less heat and use less energy. The more powerful the graphics card, for example, the bigger it is and requires more energy, therefore producing more heat. That is why laptops are not too powerful, because they have limited space and need to be small for portability. Normal PCs don't have this issue as much, because they have lots of extra space, and their only limit is heat. 
		<br><br>
		Sometimes fans are not enough when trying to do some more demanding tasks, such as gaming. That is where gaming PCs come in. Gaming PCs have no size limit, and sometimes use a better cooling method than fans, but is more expensive. This is called liquid cooling.  Liquid cooling works by this rule, the cool liquid flows by the warm graphics card so the water becomes warm and the graphics becomes cool. You can get gaming laptops that can even have non integrated graphics cards to make them more powerful, and with stronger CPUs like an i7 or even i9.</p>

			<p>fun fact 1 <br>
			Sometimes fans are not powerful enough to cool a pc, so you can use liquid cooling, although it does seem counterintuitive and dangerous to keep water right next to your computer parts. 
			This is a way more effective way to cool your pc, but is expensive. As the cool liquid goes by the hot graphics card, for example, the water warms, but the GPU cools down.</p>
			<p>fun fact 2 <br>
			The first computer was initiated by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania. It is called the ENIAC.
			</p>
			<p>fun fact 3 <br>
			Windows 10 was released on June 1st 2015.
